# Energistical Networking

Simple, GUI-free wireless energy transfer network for Fabric.

It currently features a set of simple energy network consisting of network emitters, network receivers and a single network terminal. Network emitters get energy and transfer it to the terminal, while receivers receive energy from the terminal. To link network members together, use a network linker.

To craft all above, you need to gather a new kind of resources called resonance crystal. Its ores rarely generates in the End. Also, they are quite unstable, and there is a 50% chance that these ores will explode when they are mined. They will also explode when they are shot by projectiles, so be careful!
